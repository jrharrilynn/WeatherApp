This code was written by Jason Harrison-Lynn
I followed the tutorial very closely found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4dtwWgRueI
This was my first venture into Javascript coding, and pretty much anything outside of c/c++, I wish I had a better understanding of the language so I could add more customization to it. 
This has completely reignited my love for coding, and my drive and passion to learn. This is what I have been wanting to do, I didnt realize the first steps were so close i guess. 
Thank you for giving me this opppurtunity to do this. 
The API I used was the openWeather API.
